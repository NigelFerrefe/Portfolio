        <h4>Who am I ?</h4>
        <p>
          I&apos;m Nigel Ferreres, a junior web developer specializing in the MERN
          stack. With a background in Digital Humanities and advanced training
          in 3D animation and interactive design, I bring a unique blend of
          creativity and technical expertise to web development. My focus is on
          creating intuitive applications that balance design and functionality,
          always seeking innovative solutions that make an impact.

        <h4>The road so far</h4>
        <p>
          My interest in history led me to pursue a degree focused on the
          classical era, which ignited my passion for preserving and sharing
          historical knowledge in new ways. This journey led me to complete a
          Master&apos;s in Digital Humanities, where I discovered the power of
          technology in transforming how we engage with the past. During this
          time, I developed foundational skills in web development, including
          HTML, CSS, SQL, and database management.

          When the pandemic hit, I turned to 3D modeling, designing realistic
          environments for historical reconstructions and video games. Through
          hands-on projects, I gained proficiency in programming languages such
          as C# and honed my skills in audiovisual post-production, lighting,
          and finishing techniques. This experience deepened my understanding of
          UX/UI principles and reinforced the importance of detail in
          interactive design.

        <p>
          To further refine my skills, I completed an intensive web development
          bootcamp at Ironhack, logging over 400 hours of practical learning.
          There, I mastered the MERN stack and built dynamic, user-centered
          applications, solidifying my ability to combine design with
          cutting-edge technology.

        <h4>Future goals</h4>
        <p>
          As a junior web developer, I&apos;m eager to continue growing and refining
          my craft. Iâ€™m excited to explore new tools, tackle challenging
          projects, and create digital products that make a meaningful
          difference. With a constant drive for curiosity and innovation, my
          mission is to bridge the gap between design and technology to deliver
          digital experiences that inspire and connect.
